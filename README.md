# Segmentable Ruler

Install link: https://owlbear-measure.onrender.com/manifest.json

## Features

- Snaps tokens to grid based on token position instead of pointer position
- Easy to create new segments and remove unwanted segments

## Why not to use this

- Doesn't support hexagonal grids yet
- Doesn't show measurement value to other users properly
- Doesn't allow rulers to be created without selecting a token

## How it works

- Select the Segmentable Ruler tool in the toolbar
- Drag a token on the character or mount layer to start measuring
- Press Z to start a new segment
- Press X to remove the last last segmentation
- Release the token to move it to the new position
- Press escape to return the token to its previous position
