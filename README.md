Currently only works with chessboard square grid.

How it works:

- Select the Measure++ tool in the toolbar
- Drag a token on the character or mount layer to make a measurement
- Press Z to make a bend in the measurement
- Press X to remove the last bend in the measurement
- Release the token to move it to the new position
- Press escape to return the token to its previous position
