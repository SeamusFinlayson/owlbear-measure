## How it works

**Setup**

- Select the Segmentable Ruler tool in the toolbar or use the shortcut **Z**

**Making a measurement**

- Drag a token or select a place on the map to make a measurement
- Press **Z** to start a new segment
- Press **X** to remove the last segment

**Finishing a measurement**

- Release the token to move it to the current position
- Press **enter** to make the ruler permanent and move the token to the current position
- Press **escape** to return the token to its initial position

## Benefits

- Snaps tokens to grid based on token position instead of pointer position
- Allows for complex paths with many segments to be measured
- Easy to create new segments and remove unwanted segments
- Works with all grid and measurement types
- Hides measurements for hidden tokens

## Limitations

- Doesn't show measurement value to other users properly
- Can't create private measurements
