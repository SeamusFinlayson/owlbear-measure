# Segmentable Ruler

_A ruler for measuring segmented paths_

Install link: https://owlbear-measure.onrender.com/manifest.json

## How it works

- Select the Segmentable Ruler tool in the toolbar or use the shortcut Z
- Drag a token or select a place on the map to make a measurement
- Press Z to start a new segment
- Press X to remove the last segment
- Release the token to move it to the current position
- Press escape to return the token to its initial position

## Benefits

- Snaps tokens to grid based on token position instead of pointer position
- Allows for complex paths with many segments to be measured
- Easy to create new segments and remove unwanted segments
- Works with all grid and measurement types
- Hides measurements for hidden tokens

## Limitations

- Doesn't show measurement value to other users properly
- Can't create rulers that remain after releasing the mouse
- Can't create private measurements
