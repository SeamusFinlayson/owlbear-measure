# Segmentable Ruler

_A ruler for measuring segmented paths_

## How it works

- Select the Segmentable Ruler tool in the toolbar
- Drag a token or select a place in the map to make a measurement
- Press Z to start a new segment
- Press X to remove the last last segmentation
- Release the token to move it to the new position
- Press escape to return the token to its previous position

## Benefits

- Snaps tokens to grid based on token position instead of pointer position
- Allows for complex paths with many segments to be measured
- Easy to create new segments and remove unwanted segments
- Works with all grid types and measurement
- Hides measurements for hidden tokens

## Limitations

- Doesn't show measurement value to other users properly
- Can't create rulers that remain after releasing the mouse
- Can't create private measurements
