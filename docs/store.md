# Segmentable Ruler

_A ruler for measuring segmented paths_

## How it works

**Setup**

- Install the extension
- Make sure the extension is enabled in the room in which you wish to use it
- Select the Segmentable Ruler tool in the toolbar or use the shortcut **Z**

**Making a measurement**

- Drag a token or select a place on the map to make a measurement
- Press **Z** to start a new segment
- Press **X** to remove the last segment

**Finishing a measurement**

- Release the token to move it to the current position
- Press **enter** to make the ruler permanent and move the token to the current position
- Press **escape** to return the token to its initial position

**Making a private measurement**

Other GMs and players are not shown your ruler and it is labeled as private. Private rulers cannot be made permanent or be used to move tokens.

- Select the **Private Ruler** from the bar at the top of your screen
- Use the same controls as you would for a normal measurement

**Clear rulers**

The trash can icon labeled **Clear Rulers** will clear all permanent rulers that you and other users have added to the scene. This button is only shown for users with GM access.

## Benefits

- Snaps tokens to grid based on token position instead of pointer position
- Allows for complex paths with many segments to be measured
- Easy to create new segments and remove unwanted segments
- Works with all grid and measurement types
- Hides measurements for hidden tokens
- Allows you to make measurements privately

## Limitations

- Doesn't show measurement value to other users properly while measuring
